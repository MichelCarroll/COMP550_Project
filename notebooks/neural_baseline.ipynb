      "Good day, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2017 ONEOK Earning's Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead, sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Andrew Ziola -- Vice President, Investor Relations\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, and welcome to ONEOK's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements or discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ. Please refer to our SEC filings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK. Terry?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry Spencer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest in investing in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call are Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs, and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I hand the call over, I have a few brief opening remarks. I want to start out by saying how much I appreciate the efforts of our employees who personally endured Hurricane Harvey. Employees at our Mont Belvieu area facilities and countless others at our company worked tirelessly to keep our assets running safely in order to provide needed services to our customers. I am very proud of them and, as expected, their dedication and commitment to this company continues to be nothing short of remarkable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also mention that the swift recovery of the Mont Belvieu infrastructure following Harvey would not have been possible without the hard work and cooperation of many of our industry peers, customers, service providers, and local governments. Many thanks to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I also want to extend our thoughts and prayers to the victims, their families, and all affected by the senseless tragedy that occurred in New York City yesterday afternoon. The city and its people will once again prove its courage and resolve as it copes with this tragic event.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to our third quarter performance, building off our second results, third quarter performance strong, benefiting from natural gas and natural gas liquids volume growth and higher transportation revenues in our natural gas pipeline segment. These results demonstrate that we are well on our way to achieving our 2017 guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As we stand today, compared to a year ago, rig counts have increased in the states we serve by 70%, driven primarily by technological advances in drilling, which has made exploration more effective, more efficient, and production more prolific. We are seeing petrochemical facilities and ethane crackers come online and expect two more to start up in the next several months.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The industry has been anticipating these start-ups for several years and now we are beginning to see real demand for ethane, which Kevin will discuss more in a moment. We're also hearing from customers about the next wave of petrochemical facilities to be designed and built on the Gulf Coast. I mention this because it's important to point out that the energy industry is once again proving its resiliency and adaptability to the marketplace. I believe ONEOK has played a big part in that by continuing to invest capital to aggregate supply and deliver it to the markets. We are well positioned to meet the needs of our customers today and we are committed to continue investing in and around our assets to meet their needs into the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Walt Hulse -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Terry. ONEOK's third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $517 million, compared with $462 million in the second quarter 2017, a 12% increase primarily driven by natural gas and natural gas liquids volume growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As noted in our earnings release, third quarter results included approximately $20 million in non-cash impairment charges related to nonstrategic assets and equity investments in our G&P segment, which impacted third quarter earnings per share by $0.03. We estimate that, without the disruption of Hurricane Harvey, the NGL segment's earnings would have been approximately $4.5 million higher for the quarter, or $0.01 per share.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, we announced our quarterly dividend of 74.5 cents per share, or $2.98 per share on an annualized basis, unchanged from the previous quarter when we increased the dividend by 21%. Dividend coverage was a healthy 1.3x for the quarter. Management still expects to recommend annual dividend increases of approximately 9-11% beginning in 2018 and annual dividend coverage of 1.2x or greater.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Since June, we've announced nearly half a billion dollars in attractive, low multiple growth projects, supported by commitments from anchor customers. In September and October, we issued 3.3 million shares through our ATM equity program, resulting in net proceeds of $184 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The proceeds of these issuance, along with cash generated in excess of dividends support these recently announced high return projects as we prudently manage our balance. We continue to see opportunities to make attractive investments supported by customer commitments. To the extent that we make additional future investments, the ATM will be one of the tools available to fund future growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ONEOK's trailing 12-month gap debt to EBITDA improved again to 4.9x at September 30. Our annualized third-quarter gap debt to EBITDA run rate was 4.6x. We continue to expect leverage to be around our target of 4x or less by late 2018 or early 2019. We continue to proactively manage our balance sheet. We repaid $1 billion in outstanding debt in July and September combined and completed a $1.2 billion senior notes offering in July, essentially extending the term of the debt at a very attractive rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We are well positioned with ample liquidity to effectively manage our debt maturities and continue to finance growth investments. As it relates to the review of rates on West Texas LPG, in last September, the administrative law judge provided its finding to the Railroad Commission of Texas, which the commissioners may accept, modify, or remand for further proceedings. There is no deadline for them to take action, but we anticipate the commissioners may consider the findings and any exceptions filed by the parties this December.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the outcome, we do not expect Railroad Commission's decision to have a material impact on our financial results. It will also not impact our current or future negotiated rates on West Texas LPG, nor will it hinder our ability to secure new NGL supply from producers and processors, as noted by our recent announcement to expand into the heart of the Delaware Basin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In yesterday's earnings announcement, we maintained our 2017 guidance outlook, which was updated last quarter to reflect the completion of the ONEOK and ONEOK Partners merger transaction. We expect to announce 2018 guidance sometime after the first of the year. Please refer to our news release, investor presentation, and 10-Q filings for additional details on the quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at each of our business segments.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Kevin Burdick -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Walt. Starting with our natural gas liquids segments, third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 8% compared with the second quarter 2017, including the impact from Hurricane Harvey, which lowered our EBITDA by approximately $4.5 million. We sustained no significant damage to our facilities but experienced reduced volumes due to industry downtime and increased operating costs following the hurricane. We essentially realized no benefit from optimization directly related to the hurricane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As we look forward, we have seen wider spreads so far early in the fourth quarter. NGL volumes gathered averaged approximately 812,000 barrels per day, a 5,000 barrel per day increase compared to the second quarter 2017. Higher Midcontinent volumes and higher volumes on our West Texas LPG Pipeline drove the increase. Volumes on our Bakken NGL Pipeline decreased slightly from the second quarter due primarily to plant maintenance activities at our Garden Creek and Grasslands Natural Gas processing plants in the Williston Basin and planned maintenance on the Overland Pass Pipeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As we discussed previously, our Bakken NGL Pipeline can run above its nameplate capacity of 135,00 barrels per day, and through October, volumes had returned to levels at or above what we experienced in the second quarter. We continue monitoring producer customer activity as well as the current utilization of Overland Pass Pipeline and are evaluating our options to provide additional capacity out of the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Third quarter NGL volumes fractionated were down slightly compared with the second quarter 2017, primarily impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Volumes that were unable to be fractionated during the third quarter were stored and will be fractionated in either the fourth quarter of 2017 or the first quarter 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ethane rejection levels on our NGL system remained relatively unchanged in the third quarter 2017, averaging more than 150,000 barrels per day, similar to second quarter levels. As multiple petrochemical facilities are expected to come online in the next few months, we continue to expect ethane recovery levels will fluctuate in the fourth quarter and into early 2018 as these start-ups occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As we have moved into the fourth quarter, we have seen a significant increase in our gathered volumes. In October, we exceeded 900,000 barrels per day on numerous days. The increase is a combination of volume growth from overall raw feed and additional ethane that is being recovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For the natural gas gather and processing segment, third quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased 11% compared with the second quarter 2017. With the segment once again posting solid volume growth in the Williston Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas. In the Williston Basin, volumes processed again established new highs with an average of more than 840 million cubic feet per day during the quarter, despite planned maintenance at some of our processing facilities and the maintenance on Overland Pass Pipeline. Midcontinent volumes averaged more than 740 million cubic feet per day, and 8% increase compared with the second quarter 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Rigs remained steady across our acreage with approximately 30 rigs operating on our dedicated acreage in the Williston Basin and approximately 15 rigs on our dedicated acreage in the STACK and SCOOP areas combined. In the Williston Basin, we connected 130 wells during the third quarter for a total of 313 through the first nine months of the year, well on our way to completing our target of 400 in 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We now estimate that drilled but uncompleted wells on our dedicated acreage increased to between 350-400, compared with 300 previously. We continue hearing of improved efficiencies across the basin, including indications of between 10-15% productivity improvements in wells completed in 2017 compared with 2016. At current rig activity levels, in addition to duck inventories in the basin, we expect continued volume growth into 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Growth in the Midcontinent continues as well. We connected 35 wells in the Midcontinent during the third quarter, and have connected 76 during the first nine months of the year, well on track to reach our target of 100 by the end of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The segment's average fee rate was $0.86 per MMBtu in the third quarter 2017, compared with $0.76 per MMBtu in the third quarter of 2016, a 13% increase, which was driven primarily by increased volumes on contracts where we received higher fees. We still expect the segment's average fee rate to be approximately $0.85 for all of 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the natural gas pipeline segment, adjusted EBITDA increased 8% in the third quarter 2017 and 13% through the first nine months of the year compared with the same periods in 2016. The segment continues to benefit from higher fee-based earnings and increased transportation capacity contracted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We continue discussions with producers and markets to develop long-term natural gas takeaway solutions across our footprint, especially out of the Permian Basin, where we have had a long-standing asset position with our West Tex Pipeline System and recently our joint venture Roadrunner Pipeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As Walt discussed, we've announced nearly half a billion dollars of capital growth projects, with the most recent being the $200 million expansion of the West Texas LPG Pipeline into the prolific Delaware Basin, one of the fastest growing plays in the US. The project is supported by long-term dedicated NGL production from two third-party natural gas processing plants, which we estimate will produce up to 40,000 barrels per day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2018. Fees on this project are negotiated bundled rates at market-based transportation and fractionation rates. Because this is an extension and expansion of an existing pipeline asset, we expect EBITDA multiples to be in the 4x-6x range, better than our typical 5x-7x. Additionally, the lateral is sized to allow for future growth beyond the initial two plants. We continue to discuss opportunities with numerous customers in the Delaware regarding potential contracts with more than ten new processing plants in the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry, that concludes my remarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry Spencer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks, Kevin. I have just a couple of closing comments as it relates to our future growth projects before we take your questions. Following the West Texas LPG expansion announcement, we still continue to develop our unannounced inventory of potential capital growth projects. We've updated that inventory, which is now between $2.5-3.5 billion compared with $1.5-2.5 billion previously. This inventory remains heavily focused on NGL infrastructure, which we anticipate could be announced between now and 2020. We are expanding our existing businesses and continuing to focus on deploying capital prudently at attractive returns and ways that will create value for our customers and investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I want to once again thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and their commitment to safe operations, our customers, and the communities we operate in.\n",

      "\n",
      "Shneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Analyst\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. To start off, I was wondering if we could talk about your CapEx funding strategy going forward. You tapped the ATM this past quarter and I'm trying to understand. Is it more because you were during a blackout during the merger process and needed to get leverage and line posts closed and no longer expect to use it and use retained DCF? Or, alternatively, do you continue to plan on using the ATM as a primary source of funding?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Walt Hulse -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Shneur, there was no relation to the period of time between the announcement of the merger and the closing of the merger. It's important to note that we've announced these $500 million or so of new growth projects since June and we wanted to use the ATM to make sure that we funded those because they were in addition to the CapEx that we had previously been discussing. It was more of getting ahead of the game and making sure that, as we look at forward growth projects, we maintain a very strong balance sheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Shneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Analyst\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. And then, secondly, the $500 billion of identified CapEx for 2018, are there any other projects that you're very close to approving or moving forward with that could take the number up materially in 2018? Or, is that the run rate we should be thinking about?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry Spencer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you should always think about that -- we've got this base run rate of routine growth, but we're continually working this backlog of new projects. As contractual commitments and anchor customers come together, certainly we'll go forward and take those projects to our board. We have a number of projects that are in various stages of development, and as those things mature, like we've always said, once we get those approved by our board, we'll certainly go public with those.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Shneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Analyst\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. Final question. You've had this forecast out there for dividend growth around the 10% range for several years going forward. How much capital do you need to be investing in to achieve that growth rate over the next couple of years? Is it a couple hundred million dollars? Is it more than you're running at? Less? Just kind of wondering what's the cadence to being able to achieve that growth rate, operating leverage versus needing to invest the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Walt Hulse -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure. The dividend growth rate that was previously announced was supported by base growth CapEx in line with the past couple of years. New projects enhance these cash flows and will produce more free cash flow to reinvest in our business and maintain our strong balance sheet.\n",

      "\n",

      "Good morning. Terry, I just wanted to pick up on one of your last comments with regards to the upsize in the growth project evaluation list, going up to $2.5-3.5 billion. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what specifically is driving that or what's changed? It sounds like the NGL pipeline is a part of the driver there, but is there any more you can share as far as what basins or anything else in the market that's evolved that you guys see as better opportunities now?\n",

The prospects, as Kevin mentioned on his call remarks, look great as we continue to see strong development in the STACK and SCOOP. This recent announcement in West Texas is an indicator of the opportunity that's in front of us there. The bulk of the CapEx -- this increased CapEx in this unannounced backlog is going to be in the NGL segment. It'll be in the form of pipeline loops, pumps, pipeline infrastructure, potentially fractionation capacity, and some storage in there possibly. Projects of that nature, primarily, is what that consists of. Kevin, do you have anything you could add to that?\n",

So, yes, if you maintain this activity level at 30 rigs, the 400 would be light as we think about 2018. Not ready to get out there with the guidance yet. We'll do that as we release our financial guidance. But clearly, you're right. The 27 is high, so we'd expect the well connects to go up in '18. Mike?\n",

How strongly it has performed this year would imply a decline in 4Q just to get to the high end of the guidance range there. It seems that you're being a little bit conservative by not raising guidance, in my opinion.

We do historically see a little bit of a pullback of our volumes, so we do factor that in. I don't think we see any lingering effects related to Harvey from our business. As we've talked about, we've seen transitioning a little bit, just overall, the volume growth we've seen in October in our NGL segment. Clearly, a decent chunk of that volume growth would be ethane, which would send the signal that the ethane recovery story is starting a little bit.

      "Kevin Burdick -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer\n",
      "\n",

      "Well, we're really seeing increase in all of our regions. We talked about the Bakken barrels being down and now we're back up to those levels before. Midcontinent volumes are up as well. A chunk of that is going to be ethane, as we have seen ethane recovery pick up during the month of October. We still think that will fluctuate a little bit as these new pet-chems come online and go through the start-up. But again, we've seen some nice volume growth out of all the areas.\n",

      "Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, they will be close. Typically, we have a little bit of a breakdown for Ethane and a little bit of an incentive, but it's going to be materially in the line of what we've given. Remember, a lot of the ethane that's probably coming on is going to be a Belvieu based barrel coming out of the Midcontinent, which will be at a higher than the average rate that we have in our presentation. That has both Conway and Belvieu in it, and we talk about the Midcontinent. We'll probably be just slightly higher than that.\n",

      "Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids\n",

You could see a good chunk of this coming in at 4x-6x, but I think broadly speaking overall, some of the larger infrastructure projects that are in that mix are going to be in your 5x-7x that we've historically indicated.

      "Yes, you're right. We have seen an increase in spreads through the month of October. We do think there is some likelihood that those will maintain for two or three months, or beyond that. On the flipside, as our volumes do increase, that will reduce a little bit the amount of volume we can actually move on the pipes as we physically are flowing more volume on our assets. So, there is a little bit of a give and take there, but yes, it's nice to have that tailwind of the stronger spreads. Sheridan?\n",

      "Understood. With respect with the $200 million West Texas LPG expansion -- I guess 160 at net to OKE -- I think three years ago, the guidance was given that you were hoping to achieve on the original acquisition and follow-on business, including maybe $500 million of expected growth CapEx, you're expecting to achieve an all-in 6x-8x multiple by the end of the decade. It seems like maybe the growth CapEx figure is coming well under the $500 million you all envisioned years ago. Do you see that due to efficiencies, but the EBITDA expectation would be intact? How do you see that multiple playing out over time?\n",

We knew it would take us some time when we bought the assets to get our strategy in place because a lot of the plants that were coming on when we first bought the assets were already committed. So, we knew we had to wait for the second wave of gas plants being built that were not committed, and that's where we are right now. And, we're finding that we can very effectively compete for these gas plants. I still think that we will reach that 6x-8x by the end of the decade.\n",

If we keep growing like this, as Terry mentioned, we will probably end up having to build more fractionation capacity and we'll see the Permian as being able to help support that growth and we will get market rates for that.\n",

Obviously, the DAPL was sitting out there for a long time at a storied history to get in service, but now that it is and we're seeing clear book pricing at a premium, in your conversations with producer counterparts up there, how much is the pipeline being in place and the pricing dynamic, if at all, is shaping decisions and how long they see that evolving over time?\n",

We typically hear that their netbacks are maybe $2.00-3.00 better than they were before DAPL. That's just increased strength and helped their cash flow to fund more drilling. Certainly, operational reliability has to have improved significantly.\n",

      "Mike Fitzgibbons -- Vice President, Commercial\n",

      "Okay. For Sheridan, this is a question to which I'll plead ignorant. What is your expectation, or have you guys looked at, what happens with ethylene and polyethylene markets when we bring on this much seam cracking capacity in a narrow window of time? I'm blind to what happens further downstream, so can you help us think about the effects of that and what your pet-chem customers are saying and thinking about it, and if there's an opportunity for you to participate at all in that?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What we hear from our customers on the polyethylene market -- I think these crackers are going to make ethylene, but you're already seeing these companies bring on ethylene to polyethylene units. So, you're really talking about where the ethylene is going. Worldwide, with the low cost of feedstocks we have in the United States, they're all saying the Gulf Coast crackers are much further to the left on the supply stack.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if we would overbuild and the world cannot consume that much polyethylene, you will see more the Naphtha crackers and Far East crackers being shut down -- maybe some European crackers -- a long time before you see the Gulf Coast crackers shut down. That's why you're seeing the next wave of crackers being talked about on the Gulf Coast. This is the most advantaged placed today to build crackers due to the cost of feedstocks.\n",

      "\n",
      "Chris Sighinolfi -- Jefferies -- Analyst\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The multi-year view, then, if I were to paraphrase it, is something similar to what we're seeing with other departments, where US markets -- simply because of advantaged cost structure, pushes out higher cost supply globally. So, we're basically going to make end roads via export. That's the expectation?\n",

      "\n",
      "Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I think, from a demand side, you're going to see the growth from China and India. We also see some from Latin America and maybe a little bit from Europe. But, China and India are going to be the big movers on the demand side. On the competition for supply, the only thing that's going to affect that is the gas to oil ratio. If you would see oil and gas on a BTU basis come back closer together and Naphtha would become more advantaged, you may see -- I would think we would see on supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It depends on how you look at supply competition. Obviously, we are exporting propane and ethane, which are going to crackers that would compete polyethene against our polyethene that's being produced in the United States. But, that's still pulling the hydrocarbon through our system and out of the United States.\n",

      "\n",
      "Chris Sighinolfi -- Jefferies -- Analyst\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Right. So, if we're seeing the next wave of pet-chem crackers at least talked about to be built domestically, it would seem like that community's making a determination that the facility better exists here than to export the ethane to whatever foreign market and crack it there? Is that fair, or is there something about the nature of all of this that I don't understand?\n",

      "\n",
      "Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's a combination. Where we're seeing most of the people that want to export ethane for cracking, or even propane for cracking -- in India and China, I think they want to build their own facilities and get advantage of the cheap feedstock from the United States. The people that are building the next wave of crackers are the ones that built the first wave. They're going to be the ExxonMobil SABI cracker down at Corpus Christi that's been announced. All of the other people are also talking about when do they build their next cracker, and all of them are saying it's probably going to be in the Gulf Coast.\n",
